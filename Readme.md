PLEASE READ: 
The code is messy because the topics listed below are covered back to back in the tutorial I am watching so the concepts keep layering on top of each other until the Main method becomes very sloppy. I would never write code in a live environment like this. I uploaded the code only to show a demonstration of the topics that I am touching up on.
